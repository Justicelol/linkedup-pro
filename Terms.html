  <h1>LinkedUp – Terms of Service</h1>
  <small>Last updated: December 2025</small>

  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the LinkedUp Twitch
    extension (“Extension”) developed and operated by the individual developer
    known as “LinkedUp” (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Use of the Extension</h2>
  <p>
    By enabling or using the Extension, you agree to comply with these Terms and
    Twitch’s global Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and any applicable
    developer or user policies. If you do not agree, do not use the Extension.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Features</h2>
  <p>
    LinkedUp provides discovery, collaboration tools, LFG (Looking For Group)
    indicators, and creator connection utilities. These features rely on basic
    public Twitch account data and settings you configure.
  </p>

  <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for any content or messages you submit through the
    Extension, including collab notes, descriptions, and requests. You agree not
    to engage in harassment, spam, impersonation, or misuse of the Extension.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Guarantee of Matches</h2>
  <p>
    LinkedUp does not guarantee successful collaborations, matches, or outcomes.
    All interactions between creators are voluntary and unaffiliated with Twitch
    or the developer.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    LinkedUp processes minimal Twitch account data necessary to operate the
    Extension. For details, see our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All branding, UI, features, and code within the Extension are owned by the
    developer and may not be copied or redistributed without permission.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Modifications</h2>
  <p>
    We may modify these Terms at any time. Updated versions will be posted on
    this page, and the “Last updated” date will be refreshed.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
